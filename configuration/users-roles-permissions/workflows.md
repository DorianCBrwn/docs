Workflows are a way to add structured stages to the flow of content authoring. They are primarily defined through the
permissions for a Collection, but can be further enhanced via email notifications, custom interfaces, and automation.
Directus supports endlessly configurable workflows, so we will only cover one simple example below.

1. To create a structured workflow for **Articles**, the first step is
   [Creating a Field](/configuration/data-model#creating-a-field) to track the article "status" â€” we'll call it
   **Status**, but it can be named anything.
2. Next, create different Roles for each stage of the workflow, such as `author` and `manager`.
3. Finally, configure the Role permissions based on the possible values of that Status field, such as `draft`, `review`,
   `approved`, and `published`, so that they are properly restricted to create content and update the status.
   - The Author can create content, but only save a status of `draft` or `review`.
   - The Manager has additional permissions that allow them to save statuses of `approved` or `published`.

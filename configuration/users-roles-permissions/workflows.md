# Workflows

Workflows are a way to add structured stages to the flow of content authoring. To do this, a workflow uses custom access
permissions to grant/deny user(s) access to item(s), conditionally. From there, workflows can be further enhanced via
[custom interfaces](/extensions/interfaces.md) and [flows](/configuration/flows.md).

<!--
3 Workflows
- Content Status - outline, draft, editing, review, published
- Project Mgmt - add a notification and update to Insights
- Validation - save as done, triggers a flow to check work, returns grades

1. To create a structured workflow for **Articles**, the first step is
   [Creating a Field](/configuration/data-model#creating-a-field) to track the article status â€” we'll call it `status`,
   but it can be named anything.
2. Next, create different roles for each stage of the workflow, such as `author` and `manager`.
3. Finally, configure the role permissions based on the possible values of that `status` field, such as `draft`,
   `review`, `approved`, and `published`, so that they are properly restricted to create content and update the status.
   - The Author can create content, but only save a status of `draft` or `review`.
   - The Manager has additional permissions that allow them to save statuses of `approved` or `published`.
